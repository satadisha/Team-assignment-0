# Team-assignment-0

The purpose of this assignment is to sign up as teams.

1. Select your team partner.
2. All students in the team should accept the invitation link of this assignment.
3. One student of each team will need to register themselves as a new team when signing up. The other member of the team should accept the invitation once the team has been signed up and select the already registered team from the list of teams to join, when signing up.
4. Once both members have registered as a time, the rest of the steps are similar to an individual assignment.
5. Both members will have access to the team repository, one submission repository will be created per team.
6. Members can make changes to the repository on repl.it and then commit their changes back to the remote team repository on Github classroom for the TA and the instructor to track.

### A step-by-step guide has been posted in the Piazza group.
